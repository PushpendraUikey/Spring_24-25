The random_state argument in scikit-learnâ€™s train_test_split function controls the randomness 
of the data shuffling before splitting. Setting it to an integer ensures that every time you 
run the code, the same split is produced, which is useful 
for reproducibility. If it's left as None, a different random split will be generated each time.
