    a> Processor: It is a CPU capable of accomplishing any task by itself where usually a system
                has only one CPU but it can also have multiple CPU's.
        Core: It is the processing unit within the CPU and it is capable of doing a set of instrunction
                or a specific thread. It is used for multithreaded implementation.


    b> My system has 6 CPU cores
    c> My machine has 1 physical Processor
        It has 2 threads per core making 6*2=12 logical processors appearing.

    d> Each Processor has a frequency of 2496.006 Mhz 
        around 2.4 Ghz which is 2.4 billion clock-cycles per second, which is
        2.4 billion instrunction execution per second at each core.

    e>  Architecture:             x86_64
        CPU op-mode(s):         32-bit, 64-bit
        Address sizes:          39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
        Byte Order:             Little Endian

    f> MemTotal:        3911604 kB

    g> MemFree:         3048388 kB

    h> Number of context switches: 5840675 CPU context switches
        38047 forks

    A) PID: 35813 
    B) CPU: 100%
        Memory: 0.0%
    C) It is running

Common Process States:
    R: Running (or runnable)
    S: Sleeping (in interruptible sleep)
    D: Waiting in uninterruptible sleep (typically for I/O)
    Z: Zombie (terminated but not reaped by the parent process)
    T: Stopped (by a signal or debugger)
    I: Idle (not running, waiting for resources)

    E) cd and history are shell code while ls and ps are executables.



top command

k: Kill a process by entering its PID.
r: Renice a process to change its priority.
q: Quit top.

M: Sort processes by memory usage.
P: Sort processes by CPU usage.
T: Sort by time (cumulative CPU time).

-n [count]: Updates output [count] number of times and then exits.
-u [username]: Displays processes belonging to a specific user.
-p [pid]: Monitors specific processes by PID.

Run top in batch mode with top -b, which outputs the data for use in scripts or log files.
"htop" is the command for more user friendly interface.

The ps command in Linux is used to view information about currently running processes 
on the system. Unlike top, which provides a dynamic and real-time view, 
ps generates a static snapshot of processes at the moment it is run.
: ps runs well with the pipelining with commands like "grep" and "awk".
